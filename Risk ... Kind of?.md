# Risk ... Kind of?



#### Instructions:
1. The game begins when the player hits the "Start Game" button.
2. The players then alternate placing armies on the map.
3. Once all armies are placed, it is Player 1's turn to click on a country to attack from and subsequently choose a territory to attack. 
4. When choosing a country to attack from, the players must select territories that have armies of 2 or more.
5. The player then "rolls" the die and the outcome decreases armies accordingly. 
6. The player keeps rolling until either the attacker territory or the defender territory hits 0 or -1.
7. Player one continues attacking territories until it no longer has any territories of 2 armies or more.
8. Player 2 starts attacking, and as soon as they also no longer have any territories of 2 armies or more, the winner is determined by whoever gained the most territories. 
9. Lastly, this game is similar to the board game in as it also uses the honor system.
